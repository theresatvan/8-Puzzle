# 8-Puzzle
The purpose of this project is to implement the A* algorithm in through a graph search and a tree search. Each search will be done with two heuristic measures: h1 , which measures the amount of misplaced tiles in a given state, and h2 , which measures the distance of all the misplaced tiles from their correct location in a given state. We will be comparing the time it takes to execute each algorithm with each heuristic and the amount of nodes searched.
